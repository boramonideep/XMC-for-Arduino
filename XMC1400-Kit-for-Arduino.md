# Overview
This pages summarizes information about the XMC1400 Kit for Arduino evaluation board and its implementation for the Arduino IDE. The XMC1400 Kit for Arduino board consists of a XMC1400 microcontroller with a debugger implemented by a XMC4200 microcontroller. The Infineon homepage of the board can be found [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc1400_arduino/).

# Arduino Pin Out
The pin layout of the XMC1400 Kit for Arduino for the Arduino IDE is as follows (the original file can be found [here](https://github.com/Infineon/Assets/blob/version-2.x/Pictures/XMC%201400_KitforArduino_PO_v2.png)).

## Important Note

Please note that pins **P1.4** and **P0.5** are **swapped** on the board and are not consistent with the silkscreen. As a result, interrupt 0 (INT0) occurs at **Arduino pin 3** and inerrupt 1 (INT1) is located at **Arduino pin 25**. 

This is different from the original Arduino UNO Rev3 implementation. Please look at the pinout diagram above for more information.
