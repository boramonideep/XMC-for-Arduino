Arduino Uno R3 format dictates that A4 and A5 are also used for I2C operations, so when I2C is enabled analogue inputs A4 and A5 are **NOT** available.

On Arduino Uno R3 this is an alternate pin function, depending on which XMC-for-Arduino boards this could be an alternate pin function, or other case as described below
