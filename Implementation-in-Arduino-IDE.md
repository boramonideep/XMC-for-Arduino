## Overview
This repository contains the integration of [Infineon's](https://www.infineon.com/) XMC microcontrollers into the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
Supported boards by this repository are listed under 'Microcontroller Boards' in the following section or in the sidebar. Boards currently in development are not listed here at the moment.

## Installation Instructions

### Prework for SEGGER J-Link

In order to use the Infineon XMC microcontrollers by this repository and program them, you need [SEGGER J-Link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) installed on your PC. Please follow this link [SEGGER J-Link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) and install the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack for your respective operating system (OS).
If you have already installed '[DAVE™ - Development Platform for XMC™ Microcontrollers](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/microcontroller/32-bit-industrial-microcontroller-based-on-arm-registered-cortex-registered-m/dave-version-4-free-development-platform-for-code-generation/channel.html?channel=db3a30433580b37101359f8ee6963814)', you might skip this step as you should have the respective drivers on your system.
