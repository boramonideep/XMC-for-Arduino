# Overview
This pages summarizes information about the XMC4400 Platform 2Go evaluation board and its implementation for the Arduino IDE. The XMC4400 Platform 2Go evaluation board consists of a XMC4700 microcontroller with a debugger implemented by a XMC4200 microcontroller. The Infineon homepage of the board can be found [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc_plt2go_xmc4400/).
Please note that there exist versions with 5 V and 3.3V. Please be careful which version you have and use with your respective shields. The one described here means the 5 V version as this one is compatible with Arduino shields designed for the 5 V systems.
This kit has the XMC4400 device with debugger plus ETHERNET, CAN, ARDUINO, MikroBUS and Shields2Go form factor. 
Equipped with an ARM® Cortex®-M4 based XMC™ Microcontroller from Infineon Technologies AG, the XMC4400 Platform2Go is designed to evaluate the capabilities of Infineon’s XMC4400  Microcontroller. It can be used with a wide range of development tools including Infineon’s free of charge Eclipse based IDE DAVE.
