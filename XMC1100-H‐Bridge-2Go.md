# Overview
This pages summarizes information about the [XMC H-Bridge Kit 2GO](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/evaluation-boards/h-bridge-kit-2go/) evaluation board and its implementation for the Arduino IDE. XMC H-Bridge Kit 2GO is fully populated with all electronic components equipped with the H-Bridge [IFX9201](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/power/motor-control-ics/intelligent-motor-control-ics/integrated-full-bridge-driver/ifx9201sg/) combined with XMC 1100 Microcontroller  to realize your own DC motor control. It is designed for the control of DC motors or other inductive loads up to 6 A or up to 36 V of supply. The Infineon homepage of the board can be found [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/evaluation-boards/h-bridge-kit-2go/).
