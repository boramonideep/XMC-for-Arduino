# Overview
This pages summarizes information about the XMC4700 Relax Kit evaluation board and its implementation for the Arduino IDE. The XMC4700 Relax Kit board consists of a XMC4700 microcontroller with a debugger implemented by a XMC4200 microcontroller. The Infineon homepage of the board can be found [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/KIT_XMC47_RELAX_5V_AD_V1/productType.html?productType=5546d46250cc1fdf0150f6a27dbf6e8a).
Please note that there exist versions with 5 V and 3.3V. Please be careful which version you have and use with your respective shields. The one described here means the 5 V version as this one is compatible with Arduino shields designed for the 5 V systems.
