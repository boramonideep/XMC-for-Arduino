# Overview
This page summarizes information about the XMC4200 Platform 2Go evaluation board and its implementation for the Arduino IDE. The XMC4200 Platform 2Go evaluation board consists of a XMC4200 microcontroller with a debugger implemented by a XMC4200 microcontroller. The Infineon homepage of the board can be found [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc_plt2go_XMC4200/).
Please note that there exist versions with 5 V and 3.3V. Please be careful which version you have and use with your respective shields. The one described here means the 5 V version as this one is compatible with Arduino shields designed for the 5 V systems.
This kit has the XMC4200 device with debugger plus ETHERNET, CAN, ARDUINO, MikroBUS and Shields2Go form factor. 
Equipped with an ARM® Cortex®-M4 based XMC™ Microcontroller from Infineon Technologies AG, the XMC4200 Platform2Go is designed to evaluate the capabilities of Infineon’s XMC4200  Microcontroller. It can be used with a wide range of development tools including Infineon’s free of charge Eclipse based IDE DAVE. 

# Arduino Pin Out
The pin layout of the XMC4200 Platform 2Go evaluation board (for 5V Shields) for the Arduino IDE is as follows (the original file can be found [here](https://github.com/Infineon/Assets/blob/version-2.x/Pictures/xmc4200_platform2go_PO_v2.png)):

## Important Note

Please note that **Arduino pin number 15 & 21 (SCL & A5)** and **Arduino pin number 14 & 20 (SDA & A4)** are **connected** with each other on the board itself. 
Although they are different physical pins of the microcontroller, they are connected with each other on the board to comply with the original Arduino UNO Rev3 pin connections. This influences analog measurements on A4 and A5 if you are using I2C simultaneously.
Details of the connection can also be found in the schematics in the user manual of the board [here](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-XMC4200_Platform2Go-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d4626f229553016f8fc159482c94).

A workaround is to set the I2C pins to output open drain via `pinMode(<pinNumber>, OUTPUT_OPENDRAIN);` and writing a HIGH afterwards via `digitalWrite(<pinNumber>, HIGH);` to turn it off if you want to use the analog pins (but then I2C cannot be used anymore). Tri-state via `pinMode(<pinNumber>, XMC_GPIO_MODE_INPUT_TRISTATE);` is also possible, but the open drain method is preferable as explained [here](https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino/issues/164#issuecomment-714804397) for some use cases. These functions are using the pin mode definitions from the XMC Peripheral Library defined [here](https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino/blob/0dcbd5822cb59d12a7bdae776d307fae9c607ed7/cores/xmc_lib/XMCLib/inc/xmc4_gpio.h#L206).

You can also cut the connection to the pins physically by cutting the marked blue routes on the back side of the PCB:
